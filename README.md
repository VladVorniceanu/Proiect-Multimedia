Hi!

This is a short and not so complicated project that I made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript programming languages.

This project stands for a webpage where you can easily visualize live data, fetched from the EuroStat Database, data related to the Population, Live Expectancy and GPB of 27 European states in the 2007-2021 time frame. The data is being fetched through a public Eurostat API which provides the user with the latest data at every render of the site. 

The data provided by the database is afterwards processed and shown interactively. 
Momentarily, you can easily view:
  - a SVG chart that shows the evolution of Population for each individual state chosen from the dropdown.
  - a bubble chart that enables the viewer to compare the GPB of each country in a specific year

This project is intendend to be used only as an experimental feature, as it was made as a scientific project for the final grade of a University class.
